# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello, I chose my username by trying to get a short username. 
It was then that I stumbled upon the name ajax, a famous character
from Homer's Illiad. Too famous perhpas ,because it was already taken.
I thought that maybe a small modification to the name would allowmy to
have the cool name of ajax. At first I tried ajyax, but I was a little
worried about pronounciation of the first 'a'. (i.e. ayjax not ahjax)
I looking up the pronounciation of ajax I noticed that ae is a very 
greek spelling and was used in the pronounciation guide for "ajax".
Therefore, I decided on the name aejax.
